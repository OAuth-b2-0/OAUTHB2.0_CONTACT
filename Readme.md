## ‚û°Ô∏è Introduction 
Our goal is to create a secure, decentralized authentication system using the original consortium blockchain. We aim to provide users with greater control over their data and privacy, ensuring that their information is protected and accessible only to authorized parties. By leveraging blockchain technology, we can create a tamper-proof, transparent system that enhances security and trust in online interactions.

## Request and Response Structure 
The request and response structure of the OAuth b2.0 protocol is shown below:
